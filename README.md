## Setup Instructions

### Database Setup

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and add the database connection information.

You'll also need PostgreSQL for this.

#### PostgreSQL Installation Instructions

Follow the instructions from the PostgreSQL step on https://github.com/upleveled/system-setup/

```
Run the following queries inside of psql to set up the database and the user:

CREATE DATABASE;

CREATE USER next_js_find_dog WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'net_js_find_dog';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE next_js_find_dog TO next_js_find_dog;

Then, to connect to the database using this new user, quit psql and reconnect:

\q

psql -U next_js_find_dog next_js_find_dog
```

You can run the migrations with the following command:
`yarn migrate up`

To drop the last migration run the following in your terminal:
`yarn migrate down`
